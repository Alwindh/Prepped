# Prepped

**Prepped** is a lightweight, modular WoW Classic / Anniversary AddOn designed to make sure you never head into combat unprepared. It provides clear, non-intrusive reminders when you're missing buffs, running low on consumables, or need a repair.

## Key Features

### Universal Reminders (All Classes)
- **Repair Reminder**: Automatically alerts you when your gear durability falls below your custom threshold.
- **Smart Stacking**: Unlike other addons, Prepped's warnings stack vertically—they'll never overlap each other, ensuring all alerts are readable.
- **Resting Logic**: Most supply reminders only trigger while you're in an Inn or Capital City, so they don't bother you while questing or raiding.

### Hunter Support
- **Ammo Management**: Separate warnings for "Low Ammo" (when resting) and "Critical Ammo" (anytime).
- **Aspect Checker**: Reminds you if you're missing an Aspect buff active.

### Mage Support
- **Reagent Tracking**: Monitors your Arcane Powder and Runes (Teleportation/Portals).
- **Buff Reminders**: Alerts you if Arcane Intellect or your Armor buff is missing.

### Shaman Support
- **Totem Reagents**: Tracking for Ankhs, Fish Oil, and Fish Scales.
- **Orb & Weapon Buffs**: Reminders for Water/Lightning Shield and Weapon Imbues (with smart spec detection for Enhancement/Dual-Wielding).
- **Duration Warnings**: Can notify you when your buffs are about to expire, not just when they are gone.

### General Utility
- **Water Tracker**: Essential for mana users; notifies you to buy more water based on a configurable threshold.
- **Min-Level Logic**: Only shows relevant reminders for your current level.

## Configuration

Type `/prepped` in-game to open the settings menu. From there, you can:
- Enable/Disable individual rules.
- Set **custom thresholds** (e.g., "Warn me if I have less than 40 Water").
- Configure **durability %** for repair warnings.
- Toggle "Warn if low" for buffs to get a head start on re-buffing.

## Installation
1. Download the `Prepped.zip` from the latest release.
2. Extract it into your `World of Warcraft/_classic_/Interface/AddOns/` folder.
3. Ensure the folder is named `Prepped`.

Or simply use CurseForge, WowUP, or any other addon manager.
